// Notes for future reference
// This is a task manager web application which I am building using php + mysql

for database design 
we have two types of tables, one that is a lists table, that contains the information about different list (a list is simply a grounp a similar task for example todo list, grocery list, etc), second we have a tasks table that simple contains tasks, 
Here is a rough database design:

tbl_lists

tbl_id (primary key)
list_name
list_description

--------------------------

tbl_tasks

task_id
task_name
task_description
list (list in which it will be added)
priority (one can set priority among different tasks as well)
deadline
